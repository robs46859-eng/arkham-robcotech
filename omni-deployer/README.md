> 💡 **Tip:** Use [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) for AI-assisted development - project context is pre-configured in `GEMINI.md`.

## Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have:
- **uv**: Python package manager (used for all dependency management in this project) - [Install](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) ([add packages](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/dependencies/) with `uv add <package>`)
- **agents-cli**: Agents CLI - Install with `uv tool install google-agents-cli`


## Quick Start

Install required packages:

```bash
agents-cli install
```

Test the agent with a local web server:

```bash
agents-cli playground
```

You can also use features from the [ADK](https://adk.dev/) CLI with `uv run adk`.

## Operating Rule

This package is planning-only. It may assemble deployment steps and approval gates, but it is not the production execution authority.

---

## Development

Edit your agent logic in `app/agent.py` and test with `agents-cli playground` - it auto-reloads on save.

## Deployment

Do not use this package as the authoritative production deployment mechanism. It should remain a planning and review tool aligned to the Azure-first repo flow.
